# Brief-introduction-of-the-whole-plan
This repository contains the  basic bioinformatic knowledge as a learning material for beginners.

#Attention to files
The files end with ".emmx" can be opened with mindmaster, a powerful tool for creating mindmaps.

#Updates
Since the project was established in Augest,2020, I'm still  working to complete the whole mindmaps for each step.
The latest update is the PCA analysis in "4.生物信息的package的使用", which needs futher update with hclusters and so on.

#Contents

1.项目概述
It concludes the attentions when first contacted with bioinformation and have a glance at some possible projects for beginners. In addition, some perfect learning materials are also recommenede.

2.测序技术
The first, second and the third sequencing technologies are introduced at the very beginning. The classification of RNA-Seq is also illustrated with several essays.Last but not the least, some important RNA-Seq steps are showed in a StatQuset video.

3.GEO数据
The first program for beginners must be GEO analysis, and I provide an example.(For more information, visit jimmy1314)

4.生物信息的package的使用
It is rather stupid to only get the code but know little of how it works.
So this mindmap introduce the R packages used in an normal GEO analysis, from the concept, the mechanism to the realization using R.
